## 5-challenge

# Description

- This project was built to create a a Work Day Scheduler, giving you the option to put text in the text box at a certain time, and the application saves that input and upon refresh, loads the inputted data in the correct time that the user originally inputted. 

- During this project, starter code was already given and I added for loops, if statements, and defined all the variables. 

- After learning about jQuery, I inputted jQuery concepts to display things like the current date in the header, added classes, and defined variables.
